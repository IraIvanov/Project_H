# That directory contains the library for working with stack structure

**That is the most briliant code for that type of problem that human been could ever seen**

The program is created for working with stack structure. 

# How to build

```terminal
  $ git clone https://github.com/IraIvanov/Project_H    
  $ cd Project_H/Stack    
  $ make    
  $ ./stack     
  ```
   After launching program from terminal using ./stack you will recieve example of working with stack, and log file (log.txt) that saves all the errors.
