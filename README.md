# That directory contains the program that solves quadratic equation

**That is the most briliant code for that type of problem that human been could ever seen**

The program is created for finding roots of quadratic equation. 

# How to build

```terminal
  $ git clone https://github.com/IraIvanov/Project_H    
  $ cd Project_H    
  $ make    
  $ ./program     
  ```
   After launching program from terminal using ./program you should input coeficents of equation using keyboard, then you get the solutions of that equathion.
